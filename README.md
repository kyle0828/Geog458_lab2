Geo-tagged tweet collection and visualization

I chose the keyword "Kobe" as my topic. As most people especially those who watch basketball, all know that Jan 26th was one-year anniversary of the death of Kobe Bryant and his daughters. This map shows that people who tweeted "Kobe" are mainly in Los Angeles, California where Kobe spent 20 years of his NBA career, and only a few tweets were tweeted outside of the US mainland.
